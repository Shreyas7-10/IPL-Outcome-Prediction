# IPL Match Outcome Prediction and Player Role Segmentation

## Overview
This project forms part of my MSc Data Science dissertation at the University of Sheffield. 
It develops an interpretable machine learning framework for:

1. Pre-toss IPL match outcome prediction using pre-match performance, contextual, and team-composition features.  
2. Unsupervised player role segmentation for batters and bowlers based on recent performance trends.  

The study uses ball-by-ball data from multiple IPL seasons (sourced from public Kaggle datasets) and applies both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to deliver predictive and diagnostic insights.

## Research Questions (RQs)
RQ1: Can unsupervised learning techniques be used to define interpretable, role-based player clusters (e.g., top-order anchors, finishers, strike bowlers) using rolling and phase-specific performance data?

RQ2: To what extent can IPL match outcomes be predicted using pre-match contextual features, such as venue effects, team composition, player form, momentum, and head-to-head strength indicators?

RQ3: To what extent does momentum (measured via recent win rate differentials) matter in IPL, and do teams with higher recent win rates tend to win more matches?

RQ4: How do aggregated team-level metrics constructed from clustered player roles and recent form influence match outcomes, based on statistical testing?

## Data Availability
The raw datasets are **not included in this repository** due to size constraints. They can be downloaded directly from Kaggle:  

- [matches.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020?select=matches.csv)  
- [deliveries.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020?select=deliveries.csv)  

Once downloaded, place both files in the same folder as this README and the notebook (`IPL.ipynb`) before running.
